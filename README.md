Hi, I am Love, fondly called LA (my initials lol, because some people find it weird calling me Love).

I am a Network Engineer 👩🏽‍💻 and a Digital Creator.

I am passionate about learning, evolving into the best version of myself.

I am currently working as a cloud network engineer, where I design and implement scalable and efficient cloud solutions. This involves understanding the team's requirements, selecting the right cloud services, and configuring the network architecture to ensure optimal performance, security, and cost-effectiveness.

Currently learning about network automation with Python and infrastructure as code.

Fun fact: I started my career as a model before transitioning into tech, and I really love games 💛, beauty, and skincare.
